## FAQ

### What is 42?
42 is a programming school, recognized as one of the best in the world, featuring an innovative and disruptive pedagogical model based on a peer-to-peer, project-based, and gamified learning system. Founded in Paris in 2013, 42 is present in more than 30 cities worldwide, offering anyone over 17 years old the opportunity to learn programming for free.

### How does the Piscine work?
The Piscine is a phase of the selection process that lasts 4 weeks and involves an on-campus experience at 42. This is typically a very intense period of great commitment and substantial learning. During the Piscine, you will discover a lot about the fundamentals of programming and the importance of teamwork.

### What are the selection criteria for the Piscine?
We do not disclose the selection criteria. However, we can tell you this: candidates who are highly dedicated, make progress, work in teams, and never give up are the ones who best fit the 42 student profile.

### Why is the Piscine called Piscine?
"Piscine" is the French word for swimming pool. It is named this because, during this phase of the process, you will dive into a vast world of programming‚Äîand learn to swim in it.

### Does 42 have ownership rights over any code that students develop during the program?
No. Students at 42 Luxembourg have full ownership of all the code they create on campus, in both program-related projects and personal projects.
